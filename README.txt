Algorithms for checking certain condtions about numbers.

Quadperfect was originally meant to test exclusively for 4-perfect numbers, but was aletered to allow for any n-perfect number.

nperfect does the same thing as Quadperfect, but was written in Mathematica. It also requires changes in the code to be able to compute values of n that aren't 2.5.

Nprimeadd and Nprimesubtract were written to test the primality (excluding the factor 2) of the the expressions n^n + n and n^n - n respectively. Their code can be aletered to fit other evaluations relatively easily.

Also, if I may, I'm going to conjecture here that the only 2.5-perfect number is 24.
